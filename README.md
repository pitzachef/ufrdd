## UFRDD ("User-Friendly Roblox Deployment Downloader")

[![Last Modified][badges/last-modified]][commits]

Locally download Roblox deployments (Windows/Mac) directly from your browser!

Hosted officially @ <https://rdd.latte.to>

### What is this?

RDD can assemble plain resources directly from Roblox's [`setup`](https://setup.rbxcdn.com) S3 storage bucket into a format the user would expect to be able to directly extract/run from. **Everything is fetched locally in your browser, without any additional required server resources!**

### Usage

```txt
[*] USAGE: https://rdd.latte.to/?channel=<CHANNEL_NAME>&binaryType=<BINARY_TYPE>&version=<VERSION_HASH>

    Binary Types:
    * WindowsPlayer
    * WindowsStudio64
    * MacPlayer
    * MacStudio
    
    Extra Notes:
    * If `channel` isn't provided, it will default to "LIVE" (pseudo identifier for
      the production channel)
    * You can provide `binaryType` to fetch the *latest* deployment on a channel, or
      BOTH `binaryType` and `version` to fetch a specific deployment of a specific
      binary type; for a specific `version`, you NEED to provide `binaryType` aswell

    You can also use an extra flag we provide, `blobDir`, for specifying where RDD
    should fetch deployment files/binaries from. This is ONLY useful for using
    different relative paths than normal, such as "/mac/arm64" which is specifically
    present on certain channels

    Blob Directories (Examples):
    * "/" (Default for WindowsPlayer/WindowsStudio64)
    * "/mac/" (Default for MacPlayer/MacStudio)
    * "/mac/arm64/"
    ..

```

### Extras

* [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) (Used for `WindowsPlayer`/`WindowsStudio` file extraction/generation)
* <https://github.com/latte-soft/channel-tracker>
